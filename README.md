Task 3: Car Price Prediction with Machine Learning
Objective:

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts the price of a car based on its various features such as brand, horsepower, mileage, engine size, and other specifications.

Tools & Technologies Used:

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

Steps Performed:

Loaded and explored the car price dataset.

Handled missing values and dropped irrelevant columns.

Encoded categorical features (like brand, fuel type, body style).

Scaled numeric data for model consistency.

Split the data into training and testing sets.

Trained a Linear Regression model to predict prices.

Evaluated model performance using R² score, MAE, and MSE.

Visualized Actual vs Predicted car prices and important features.

Outcome:

Achieved a good R² score (depending on dataset quality, typically 0.85–0.95).

Identified key factors influencing car price such as horsepower, engine size, and curb weight.

Successfully built a predictive regression model to estimate car prices.

 Learning Experience:

Through this project, I learned how to:

Perform feature encoding and normalization.

Apply regression techniques for price prediction.

Interpret model evaluation metrics.

Visualize performance and feature influence in regression models.
